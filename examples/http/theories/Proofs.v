(* =================== Nuggets from DeepWeb Server ==================== *)
(* ~~~ Notes ~~~
   Below is an experiment to define specification like the DeepWeb
   Server.

   Specifying programs using ITrees end up looking like writing
   functional programs with ITrees. The most interesting part was the
   "network refinement" relation, which uses trace semantics to reason
   about the refinement of a program. In the context of the IO monad,
   I think it would make most sense to intepret into the state monad
   instead. (State monad as a representation of """world""", as shown
   in IO.v)

   (Although in the context of concurrency, thinking about trace semantics
    *is* convenient.)
 *)

(* N.B.: These representations of "observerE" seems relevant
   for a low-level language like C. For Haskell, this doesn't seem
   terribly useful. (i.e. We can use `ioE` directly to give high-level
   specifications. `ioE` feels like it lives in a similar level of
   abstraction to the `specE` event types:

   https://github.com/DeepSpec/DeepWeb/blob/61a31786e2be7667afebcceaaac07c0e8aefa2c4/src/Free/Examples/SocketLoop.v

   where `specE` is based on `networkE` events:

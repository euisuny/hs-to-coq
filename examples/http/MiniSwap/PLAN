- Summary, main interfaces:
    SimpleSpec.v

- Server interface:
    SimpleSpec_NetworkInterface.v

- Observer interface:
    SimpleSpec_Observer.v
 
    also defines "is_trace_of" predicate (maybe needs to move)

- Definition of traces and scrambling:
    SimpleSpec_Traces.v

- State machine to model the network (needed by SimpleSpec_Traces):
    SimpleSpec_NetworkModel.v

- General correctness properties [refines_mod_network] and
  [strong_refines_mod_network]:
    SimpleSpec_Refinement.v

- Some facts to prove the equivalence between these two properties:
    SimpleSpec_Scramble.v

- Given a scrambled trace, search for descramblings: 
    SimpleSpec_Descramble.v

- Given a server, enumerate/sample its traces:
    SimpleSpec_ServerTraces.v
